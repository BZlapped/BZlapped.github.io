        <div class="map" ><p class="xd"><img class="epta" src="synclogo.jpg">This team was created from the Denial eSports team with minor roster changes - as m`ICKe left around the end of HTS2, the team picked up Khezu after some tryouts. They dominated throughout the qualifiers and placed 3rd on the LAN finals in Thailand after a clutch fight with sG in semifinals. Soon after, they replaced Support and probusk with Insania and returning m`ICKe. As sG left, Sync became the #2 team in HoN for quite some time, losing majority of games vs BMG in Carnage in Caldavar. Situation changed around when HTS3 began, as Sync managed to beat BMG in the first cycle. That was followed by major BMG roster change which pretty much secured Sync an uncontested first spot. At the verge of being the first HoN team to win 4 consecutive cycles though, BMG prevailed and took 4th cycle off of them. However, due to BMG's problems again, they became clear victors in upcoming cycles, even though they openly admitted to practicing Dota 2 instead. Finally, they managed to break the record of 4 consecutive cycle victories and 7 victories overall after winning 8th cycle, becoming the instantly qualified international team for the Grand Finals LAN. However, the LAN was the biggest disappointment of the team, as they failed to even qualify from group stages, ending 5th-6th overally. In response to that, the team even lost the first Dreamhack Qualifier, looking shakier than ever. With nothing but success in mind though, they prepared as they could, won the 2nd qualifier and dominated Deadeye Bounty League, although failing to get to Dreamhack Summer Warm-up finals and forfeiting the match for 3rd place. Shortly after, the team yet again failed to show up in the offline setting, as on Dreamhack Summer 2015 they lost both in the winner's and in the loser's bracket finals and ended up 3rd. After the event m`ICKe announced departing from the team, which began immediately looking for a new mid laner.</p></div>
